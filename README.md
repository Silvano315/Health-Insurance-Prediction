## Introduction

This repository aims to test some machine learning and explainability techniques in order to predict whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics, vehicles, policy

## Dataset

### Kaggle

The dataset for this project was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction/data

### Description

Key observations:

- Age: Skewed towards younger ages.
- Annual Premium: Positively skewed with most values concentrated at the lower end.
- Region Code: Relatively uniform distribution.
- Vintage: Nearly uniform distribution.
- Policy Sales Channel: Certain channels are used more frequently.
